Question 3:
Depending on the row in the IDT, it will generate the breakpoint exception if
user programs have permission to generate it (the dpl bit is 1), or it will
generate a general protection fault if it doesn't (the dpl bit is 0).

Question 4:
The hardware exception interrupts shouldn't be able to be called from user
programs because the user shouldn't be explicitly choosing to activate the
page fault handler, or equivalent mechanisms for other faults.
