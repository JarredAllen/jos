Question 1:
The mpentry.S, because it is run after the kernel loads itself, expects to be
linked at a high address, inside the kernel's virtual address space, but we
haven't loaded the page table yet, so it needs to look at the low physical
address that it actually is until we load the page table.
boot.S doesn't have this issue because it is linked separately from the rest
of the kernel, so it doesn't have the same issue, and can be linked at its
actual physical address.
