Question 1:
	First, the trap number would be lost if we had a single trap handler,
	since the handler for each trap is responsible for pushing the trap
	number onto the stack.
	Second, having an individual trap handler allows us to make sure there
	is always an error code on the stack, even if the processor didn't
	push an error code, we can put a bogus error code for consistency.

Question 2:
	We needed to make sure the permissions were setup correctly in trap.c.
	By setting the permissions on trap 14 (page fault) to level 0, we
	ensure the user program cannot interrupt to the trap handler for trap
	14, and instead they get a general protection fault (trap 13).
	If the user could call the page fault handler, the OS would have to
	determine why the page fault handler is being called, and spend more
	time determining if it is safe to map a page.
